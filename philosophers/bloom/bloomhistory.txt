"Hello, I am Benjamin Bloom, reowned for my psychological research in human learning."
"I spent my youth in an immigrant houshold wandering the streets of Lansford Pennsylvania."
"Have you heard of 'Bloom's Taxonomy'? That was my most famous to characterize the process of learning."
"Most of my research relates to learning, particularly how the education system can be adapted to help students learn."
"Though I am clearly passionate about learning, I've also researched the characteristics of individuals who reach extreme success."
