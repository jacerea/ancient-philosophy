Sometimes even to live is an act of courage
True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have.
Luck is what happens when prepartion meets opportunity.
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
He who is brave, is free.
No man was ever wise by chance.
All cruelty springs from weakness.
Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.
