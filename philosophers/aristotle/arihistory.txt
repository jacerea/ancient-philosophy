"Greetings, I am Aristotle, born in Classical Greece and founder of the library of the Lyceum."
"By the time I was 18, I studied philosophy under the great Plato at his academy"
"I am known for my contributions to logic. Whenever you use reasoning, I have most likely influenced that reasoning."
"Though he was my mentor, I disagree with Plato on his logic. I see the world as the intercetion of form and matter, not exlusive to one."
"Alexander the Great? I never really thought of him that way in his youth, but remember how quick he was to learn my teachings."
